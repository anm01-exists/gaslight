# StudyHub Production Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

Before deploying StudyHub to production, ensure you have:

1. **Supabase Account**: Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Domain**: Purchase a domain for your application
3. **Hosting Platform**: Choose from Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform
4. **Email Service**: For authentication emails (Supabase handles this)

## Step 1: Supabase Setup

### 1.1 Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned
3. Note down your project URL and anon key

### 1.2 Database Schema Setup

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy and paste the SQL commands from `src/lib/supabase.ts` (the `SUPABASE_SCHEMA` constant)
3. Execute the SQL to create all tables and policies

### 1.3 Storage Setup

1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. The 'notes' bucket should be created automatically by the SQL schema
3. Verify storage policies are in place for file uploads

### 1.4 Authentication Setup

1. Go to Authentication > Settings in Supabase dashboard
2. Configure your site URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
3. Add redirect URLs for development and production
4. Enable email authentication
5. Optional: Enable social providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)

## Step 2: Environment Configuration

### 2.1 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Production URL
VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 2.2 Update Database Service

The application is already configured to use Supabase. Ensure `src/lib/database.ts` is using the Supabase service layer correctly.

## Step 3: Code Updates for Production

### 3.1 Remove Mock Data

- All mock data has been removed from the application
- The app now uses real Supabase authentication
- File uploads go to Supabase Storage

### 3.2 Security Enhancements

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are enabled
- Authentication guards protect sensitive routes
- File upload security is implemented

### 3.3 Performance Optimizations

- Bundle size is optimized
- Images are compressed
- Lazy loading is implemented where appropriate

## Step 4: Deployment Options

### Option A: Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect Repository**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:

   - Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
   - Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy automatically on push

3. **Domain Setup**:
   - Add custom domain in Vercel
   - Configure DNS records

### Option B: Netlify Deployment

1. **Build Configuration**:
   Create `netlify.toml`:

   ```toml
   [build]
     publish = "dist"
     command = "npm run build"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   - Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy

### Option C: Self-Hosted

1. **Build Application**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Server Configuration**:
   - Use nginx or Apache
   - Configure HTTPS
   - Set up reverse proxy if needed

## Step 5: Post-Deployment Setup

### 5.1 Database Initialization

- The database will be empty initially
- Users can start registering and creating content
- Monitor usage through Supabase dashboard

### 5.2 Monitoring Setup

- Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up uptime monitoring

### 5.3 Backup Strategy

- Supabase handles automatic backups
- Consider additional backup strategies for critical data
- Document recovery procedures

## Step 6: Security Checklist

### 6.1 Essential Security Measures

- [ ] HTTPS enabled on custom domain
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies tested
- [ ] File upload limits and scanning enabled
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] CORS properly configured

### 6.2 Optional Security Enhancements

- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Step 7: Performance Optimization

### 7.1 CDN Setup

- Use Vercel's CDN or configure CloudFront
- Optimize image delivery
- Enable compression

### 7.2 Caching Strategy

- Configure browser caching
- Implement service worker for offline support
- Use React Query for data caching

## Step 8: Analytics and Monitoring

### 8.1 Analytics Setup

- Google Analytics or Plausible
- User behavior tracking
- Conversion funnel analysis

### 8.2 Error Monitoring

- Sentry for error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback collection

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Tasks

1. **Database Maintenance**:

   - Monitor database performance
   - Review and optimize queries
   - Clean up unused data

2. **Security Updates**:

   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security policies
   - Monitor for vulnerabilities

3. **Feature Development**:
   - Follow the roadmap
   - Collect user feedback
   - Implement improvements

## Cost Estimation

### Supabase Costs

- **Free Tier**: 50,000 monthly active users
- **Pro Tier**: $25/month for higher limits
- **Storage**: $0.021 per GB per month

### Hosting Costs

- **Vercel**: Free for personal projects, $20/month for teams
